Subject: Re: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Hi Carrie,

Thanks for providing the error message and description of your website.

The issue is likely related to the non-search metadata added to the records.
As per our documentation; "Your records should only include information that helps with searching, showing results, sorting, and relevance" (https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records).

I suggest removing the metadata that isn't intended for search, from the records.
This can be done by creating a new collection of records, excluding the non-search metadata, and uploading this new collection to Algolia.

If you/your team require assistance in doing this, I'm happy to jump on a call and help.

All the best,
Louis

Hi Marc,

Thanks for providing a picture of the error message.

From the error, it appears that the issue might be some code related to a search service other than Algolia.

Can you please confirm that you are a customer of Algolia/are using Algolia as your search provider?

All the best,
Louis
