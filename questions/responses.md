Subject: Re: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Hi Carrie,

Thanks for providing the error message and description of your website.

Based on the information that you shared, the issue is likely related to the non-search metadata being added to the records.
We advise that "Your records should only include information that helps with searching, showing results, sorting, and relevance" (https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/#algolia-records).

Thus, I suggest removing the metadata that isn't intended for search, from the records.
This can be done by creating a new collection of records, excluding the non-search metadata, and uploading this new collection to Algolia.

If you/your team require assistance in doing this, or if the errors continue, please let me know and I'll be happy to jump on a call and help.

All the best,
Louis
